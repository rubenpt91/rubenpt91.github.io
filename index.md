I am a PhD student that joined the Computer Vision community in 2018. I started working on retrieval systems related to text for both natural scenes and handwritten images. Recently I have focused on Vision and Language systems, more specifically exploring the role of recognized text in the image on Visual Question Answering task, both for documents and natural scenes.
I enjoy participating in Artificial Intelligence panels open to the public at Barcelona because one of my aims is to bring the progress and concerns from research centers to the public.
